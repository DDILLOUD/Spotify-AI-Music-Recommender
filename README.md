# AI-Powered Music Recommendation System using Spotify API and Streamlit

## Description
This project implements an AI-powered music recommendation system using the Spotify API and Streamlit. It allows users to input their favorite artists and receive personalized music recommendations based on their preferences. The system leverages the Spotify API to access a vast catalog of songs and uses machine learning algorithms to generate recommendations.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Python (version X.X.X) if not already installed.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage Instructions
To run the web app:
1. Authenticate with the Spotify API by obtaining your credentials from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
5. Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit to access the app.
6. Input your favorite artists and click the "Get Recommendations" button to receive personalized music recommendations.

## Model Details
This recommendation system uses a collaborative filtering approach to generate music recommendations. It analyzes user preferences and behavior to identify patterns and similarities between users and items. The model employs a [chosen algorithm, e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)] to make predictions based on these patterns.

## Additional Information
- **Dataset:** The system does not use a pre-defined dataset for training. Instead, it relies on real-time data from the Spotify API.
- **Limitations:** The recommendations provided may be influenced by the availability of songs on the Spotify platform and the diversity of user preferences.
- For more information on the Spotify API and Streamlit, refer to the [Spotify API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
